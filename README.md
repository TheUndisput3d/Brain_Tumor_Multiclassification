# Brain Tumor Multiclassification App

## Overview
This project implements a **Brain Tumor Classification System** using a mobile app interface, powered by **Flutter** as the frontend and **Django** as the backend. The model leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, specifically **VGG-16**, with a **Softmax** activation function for multi-class classification of brain tumors. The app is designed to classify MRI images into four categories:
- **Pituitary**
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **No Tumor**

The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly mobile app that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors using deep learning models.

## Features
- **Mobile App Interface**: Built with Flutter, enabling cross-platform use on Android and iOS.
- **Backend API**: Developed with Django, handling model inference requests from the mobile app.
- **Deep Learning Model**: CNN-based architecture with VGG-16 and Softmax for multi-class classification.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Classify brain tumor images in real-time via the mobile app.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Handles input image normalization and augmentation for improved accuracy.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Deep Learning**: 
  - TensorFlow / Keras for CNN and VGG-16 model.
  - Softmax activation function for multi-class classification.
- **Libraries**: 
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations.
  - Django REST Framework for API.
